# SE577-Course-Project

## Week-1

Hi! My name is Trev and throughout my career as a software engineer, I have embraced all aspects of product development from user experience evidence-based design to full stack development. I am also currently expanding my leadership skills by building teams that value a client focused approach that utilizes cutting edge technologies while proposing evidence-based user experience design solutions.

By taking this course, I am looking to get the understanding to better navigate between business strategy, quality attributes, human dynamics, design, and IT environments that are interwoven in software architecture and software design.
I am also hoping to gain more insight in the leadership aspect such as overseeing the development of a project and coordinating teams of developers to meet design standards.
