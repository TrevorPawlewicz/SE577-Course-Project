# SE577-Course-Project

## Main

The course project will involve building a web based, cloud native, front end to GitHub.   GitHub has some pretty good APIs to play with, and you will enrich your front end with some of your own web services.  The project will be developed incrementally over the entire course consisting of several deliverables along the way.
