# SE577-Course-Project

## Week 6 Deliverable: `proj-Release-3`

Take the code from `proj-release-2` and create a new branch `proj-Release-3`.  There will be few simple updates to this release

 Take the microservice that you built in the previous release and package and host it in a docker container.  Make sure you provide your Dockerfile in the repo, and either a script or a makefile to create the Dockerfile.  Update the user interface to work with the service running under docker.

Create an architectural model of the current state of your system – UML or C4 is fine.

Create a file called `Release3.md` and provide a section on how to run your application with the docker component, a section showing the architectural model created above.  Also provide a short narratives about the state of the current systems architecture.
