## architectural model

- *__The Docker daemon__* listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images.

- *__The Docker client__* is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker.

- *__A Docker registry__* stores Docker images.

- When you use the `docker pull` or `docker run` commands, the required images are pulled from the configured registry.

- An *__image__* is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.

- A *__container__* is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

- docker is used to host the API data for use in the UI:
