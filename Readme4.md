## GitHub OAuth login:
- Login component that has a button that triggers the login request to Github API: a request to the Github API to authorize the app.
- AuthContext to make the global state and actions in the store.
- a simple store that’ll keep hold of the application state.
- a proxy server express app to enable “Access-Control-Allow-Origin”

# My thoughts and experiences with using oAuth and tokens to integrate with github...
My overall concern is the security around the process of having personal talokens with a public repo.
Token storage, revoking tokens and expired tokens can also be tedious to constantly give attentention to being up to date.
My thoughts are that a better solution will be thought of soon.
